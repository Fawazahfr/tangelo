Welcome to Tangelo, the daily app designed for Princeton students. Inspired by the simplicity of bullet journals, our modular interface allows users to custom-build their perfect morning experience. 

Tangelo is designed to allow our users to view and organize a vast array of pertinent information from a single dashboard. Tangelo achieves this through a customizable grid of widgets. In its most basic form, a widget is simply an object that can display information and be moved around. Our widgets offer the ideal balance of utility and delight, with sleek interfaces and robust functionality for the everyday experience. Have a live calendar of important academic updates or browse the Daily Prince headlines from a single dashboard interface. With widgets ranging from the uber-practical time/date clock to a fun  birthday widget that updates you on your birthday, we have something for every kind of person.

Make life simple. Get Tangelo.
