Welcome to ~Tangelo~, the daily app designed for Princeton students. Inspired by the simplicity of bullet journals, our modular interface allows users to custom-build their perfect morning experience. 

Tangelo is designed to allow our users to view and organize a vast array of pertinent information from a single dashboard. Tangelo achieves this through a minimal dashboard display containing customizable widgets. In its most basic form, a widget is simply an object that can display information and be moved around. Our widgets offer the ideal balance of utility and delight, with sleek interfaces and robust functionality for the everyday experience. Have a live calendar of important academic updates or browse the Daily Prince headlines from a single dashboard interface.
